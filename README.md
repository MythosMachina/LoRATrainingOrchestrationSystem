# LoRATrainingOrchestrationSystem
We will build an automated LoRA training platform with ephemeral container workers. A central orchestrator manages jobs, SQL tracks state, and storage holds models, datasets, and outputs. A web UI enables dataset upload, model selection (SD1.5/SDXL), and job submission. All training steps run fully automated.
